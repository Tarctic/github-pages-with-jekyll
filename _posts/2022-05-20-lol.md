## The acronym 'lol'

I'm not sure what it is about this acronym, but it frustrates me a little bit. It is used to let someone know that you found whatever they imparted funny, but instead of it's intended result, this acronym makes it seem like you are uninterested or sarcastic.

> ***eg:***
>
> sara: why don't dinosaurs talk?  
> matt: idk  
> sara: because they're dead  
> matt: lol
>
> sara: \*starts crying*

<br />


However, when used in caps, it has the intended effect.

> sara: because they're dead  
> matt: LOL

> sara: jk \*eats matt*
